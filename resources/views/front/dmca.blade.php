                            applicable intellectual property legislation or laws. Responses may include removing,
                            blocking or
                            disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity, terminating
                            the
                            user’s access to www.worldofkink.com (“World of Kink”), or all of the foregoing.</p>
                        <p>If you believe any material accessible on World of Kink infringes your copyright, you may
                            submit a
                            copyright infringement notification (see below, “Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright
                            Infringement” for
                            instructions on filing such a notice). These requests should only be submitted by the
                            copyright
                            owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.

                        </p>
                        <p>If we remove or disable access to material in response to such a notice, we will take

                            disabled access to so that the user has the opportunity to submit a counter-notification

                            “Counter-Notification Procedures” for instructions on filing a counter-notification). It is
                            our
                            policy to document all notices of alleged infringement on which we act.</p>
                        <p>All copyright infringement notifications and counter-notifications must be written in
                            English. Any

                            discretion, be deemed non-compliant and disregarded. </p>
